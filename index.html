            <h3>2009-2014</h3>
            <p>Messing around at home</p>
            <ul>
               <li>As an early enthusiast of technology and programming, I discovered my love for programming at the age
                  of 8, when I began creating text adventure games using batch scripting on my mothers laptop. This
                  early experience ignited a passion within me, motivating me to delve deeper into the vast world of
                  computers. In my eagerness to learn, I would often take apart laptops and desktops, and then
                  reassemble them to gain a better understanding of their inner workings. These experiences fostered a
                  lifelong curiosity in the field of computing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2015-2018</h3>
            <p>HighSchool</p>
            <ul>
               <li>In high school, I was always looking for ways to use my programming skills outside of class. So, I
                  started creating small Java games and building virtual 3D worlds that my classmates could explore for
                  our assignments and projects.

                  As I got more involved in the school's IT department, I became friendly with everyone there. I even
                  helped them reconfigure the entire Wi-Fi setup and got to attend some CISCO training sessions with the
                  regular technicians.

                  Eventually, a friend and I started the "Computers Club" where we would teach other students
                  programming skills and experiment with different hardware that the IT department had lying around. It
                  was a lot of fun, and I learned a lot from it</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2019-2023</h3>
            <p>Beyond HighSchool</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  I founded a successful business in early 2019 with a modest initial capital investment of just 40
                  dollars. Over the course of four years, our team's hard work and dedication paid off, resulting in
                  revenue of over half a million rands. This experience allowed me to hone my leadership and management
                  skills while guiding a team of 5-12 professionals.

                  Throughout this journey, I developed a keen understanding of strategic design principles, content
                  moderation, and the importance of proper Linux server configuration and maintenance. As a result, I
                  gained valuable experience in Java programming, and was able to use my technical skills to optimize
                  our systems and increase our efficiency.

                  Overall, founding and managing a successful business taught me the importance of teamwork,
                  adaptability, and the value of hard work. These experiences have greatly influenced my approach to
                  software engineering, and I am eager to continue exploring the limitless potential of the field.

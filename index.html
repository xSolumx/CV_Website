            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div>I am an aspiring software
               developer in his last year of
               university with experience using
               programming and scripting
               languages, such as JavaScript,
               C# and Java. I founded and
               managed a business leading a
               team to create game server.
               Through doing this I gained
               valuable experience in project
               management and team
               leadership as well as technical
               experience in Java and Photoshop</div>

         <h1 class="card-title">A Brief Overview Of My Programming Experience</h1>
         <div class="card-text">
            <h4>2009-2014</h4>
            <p>Early Years</p>
            <ul>
               <li>As an early enthusiast of technology and programming, I discovered my love for programming at the age
                  of 8, when I began creating text adventure games using batch scripting on my mothers laptop. This
                  early experience ignited a passion within me, motivating me to delve deeper into the vast world of
                  computers. In my eagerness to learn, I would often take apart laptops and desktops, and then
                  reassemble them to gain a better understanding of their inner workings. These experiences fostered a
                  lifelong curiosity in the field of computing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2015-2018</h4>
            <p>High School</p>
            <ul>
               <li>In high school, I created Java games and virtual 3D worlds outside of class for my assignments and projects.</li>

               <li>I developed a strong relationship with the school's IT department, and contributed significantly by reconfiguring the Wi-Fi setup and attending CISCO training sessions alongside the regular technicians.</li>

               <li>I co-founded the 'Computers Club' to teach programming skills to fellow students and conduct hardware experiments using the school's resources, leading to enjoyable learning experiences and personal growth.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2019-2023</h4>
            <p>Beyond High School</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  I founded a successful business in early 2019 with a modest initial capital investment of just 40
                  USD. Over the course of four years, My team's hard work and dedication paid off, resulting in
                  revenue of over half a million rands. This experience allowed me to hone my leadership and management
                  skills while guiding a team of 5-12 people.

                  Throughout this journey, I developed a keen understanding of strategic design principles, content
                  moderation, and the importance of proper Linux server configuration and maintenance. As a result, I
                  gained valuable experience in Java programming, and was able to use my technical skills to optimize
                  our systems and increase our efficiency.

                  Overall, founding and managing a successful business taught me the importance of teamwork,
                  adaptability, and the value of hard work. These experiences have greatly influenced my approach to
                  software engineering, and I am eager to continue exploring the limitless potential of the field.
